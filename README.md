This repository contains our submission for the inventathon. It is a combination of 3 projects - a django server, served on a gcp app engine backend with postresql, a machine learning model - LGBM Regressor with a good deal of feature engineering, and of course, a beautiful flutter app that allows users to visualize factors and results of climate change through prediction and through retrospection, and in addition track their own usage. We used a variety of techniques, technologies, and fields to compose this full-stack architecture.
